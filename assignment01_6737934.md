### Effects of Cytochrome P450 2C19 and Paraoxonase 1 Polymorphisms on Antiplatelet Response to Clopidogrel Therapy in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease
| questions from the article | knowledge topic that I will have learn |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| How is reducing thrombosis is effect the coronary artery disease | Thrombosis |
| What is ADP and how its induced platelet aggregation | ADP |
| Why aged-range of this study is 39-94 years | Study Design and Sampling |
| In filtering out sample groups if there are patients who lie about their health history will it result in some of the data from this research being unreliable? | Research Ethics |
| Why using guanidine HCI method to isolated genomic DNA form whole blood| Molecular Biology Techniques |
| How the research know which part of gene that they are interested and need to amplify | Gene Targeting & Primer Design |
| What is the medthod to chooses restriction enzymes | Restriction Enzyme Selection |
| How Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) proportions can be used to test for a possible deviation of genotype distribution | HWE |
| Why the differences in allele and genotype frequencies between groups were compared using Chi-square test rather than other test | Statistcal analyses |
| In this research use the p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant, so I wonder that can we adjust the p value? if it can when it should be adjust? Is it gonna make the research be less reliable? | Statistcal analyses | 
| How Cordell's test can be use to performed the interaction between PON1 variants and CYP2C19*2 and *3 | Epistasis and Gene-Gene Interactions |
| How to choose the models to performed the interaction between two genes| Epistasis and Gene-Gene Interactions |
| What is the forensic autopsy and how it can |  |

### Molecular investigation by whole exome sequencing revealed a high proportion of pathogenic variants among Thai victims of sudden unexpected death syndrome

| questions from the article | knowledge topic that I will have learn |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| How investigate whole exome sequencing (WES) can assume to the cause of Sudden unexpected death syndrome (SUDS) in Thai victims  | Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) Methodology |
| Why in this article need to pay more attention to the lesions in the heart and surrounding vascular tissues | Sudden Cardiac Death |
| How to chooses the candidates in detail | Sampling method |
| Is the step that exclude known variants reported are important | Variant filtration |
| How to chooses the candidated for non-SUDS thai patients | Sampling method |
| Why the death from autopsy were identified as SUDS | Autopsy |
| What is Brugada syndrome, and how has it been associated with cases of sudden unexpected death in Thai survivors? | Brugada syndrome |
| Why is including the victims who died from those identifiable causes will make the study bias | Statistcal analyses |
| How do researchers determine which genetic variants are likely benign versus those that are pathogenic in SUDS cases | Genetic Variants |
| Why is the investigation of specific genes related to SUDS essential in understanding the sudden death in Thai victims? |  |
